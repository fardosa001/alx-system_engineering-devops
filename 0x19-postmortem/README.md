 The Great 500 FiascoðŸš€ðŸ’¥

Issue Summary:
Duration: 20th Jan 2024, from 08:00 AM to 20th Jan 2024 9:00 AM (UTC).
Impact: The companyâ€™s website threw a 500 Internal Server Error tantrum, playing hide-and-seek with 100% of the users. Everyone experienced slow responses, and the website thought intermittent service disruptions were the latest trend.
Root Cause:
The server had a wild party with misconfigured settings, forgot to log errors, and left everyone clueless.

Timeline:
08:00 AM (UTC): Automated monitoring spots 500 errors.
08:10 AM (UTC): Investigation kicks off, suspecting code mischief.
08:15 AM (UTC): Development team joins the code hunt.
08:30 AM (UTC): False leads in database and network; server gets extra snacks but stays 'hangry.'
08:40 AM (UTC): Crisis alert! DevOps and Sys Admin teams join forces.
09:00 AM (UTC): Sherlock moment: 'strace' reveals a 'phpp' vs. 'php' spelling showdown.
09:00 AM (UTC): Puppet script corrects spelling; hotfix superhero tackles code bug.
The server resumes spelling 'php' correctly, and peace is restored! ðŸš€ðŸ’»âœ¨

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The server was in denial about its log responsibilities, causing a 500 error identity crisis.

Resolution:
Set the server straight! Configured it to log detailed error messages for 500 responses.
Launched a full-scale code review and discovered a bug playing peek-a-boo, promptly evicted it with a hotfix.
Puppet to the rescue! Automated the fix by correcting the 'phpp' to 'php' in the config file â€“ spelling bee championship regained!
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Taught our monitoring systems to scream louder at the sight of 500 errors â€“ no more silent protests!
Instituted a comprehensive logging strategy â€“ logs are now our BFFs.
Scheduled regular server configuration audits to keep them in line with best practices.



Task List:
Gave the server a makeover with updated configurations to include error logging in its daily routine.
Hired a psychic monitoring system to predict 500 errors before they even think about happening.
Scheduled code review parties, complete with pizza, to catch potential bugs red-handed.
Established a post-incident review process â€“ the server will be on probation, and we'll be watching!
This postmortem is a reminder that even servers need therapy sometimes, and teamwork, monitoring, and a dash of humor are the secret ingredients to surviving web catastrophes! ðŸ¦¸ðŸ’»ðŸš‘
